## Disclaimer

For purposes of this presentation I want to avoid talking about particular tools, libraries, frameworks, or services.

They're _great_ and can really help the process, but I want to discuss theory instead of implementation.

# What is it?

A hypothesis is:

> “a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation”

# What is it?

Which means Hypothesis Driven Development is the process of using a hypothesis to inform feature development with the further step of validation via data.

</Split>

---

# Isn't that A/B testing?

<Steps>

## Kind of.

A/B testing can be a form of HDD.

</Steps>

---

## A/B Testing

If you're used to A/B testing, it means you're already familiar with collecting metrics.

Collecting metrics is vital for validating a hypothesis.

---

## A/B Testing

Adding HDD to an existing A/B testing flow should be easy.

---

# HDD Steps

1. Define hypothesis
2. Implement feature with metrics tracking
3. Collect data
4. Analyze

---

# Iteration

Like any new process it takes time to get good at it. There's no rigid process to follow which means it's adaptable and flexible, but also means you may need to iterate until it feels right.

---

# Implement Intelligently

* Not ever feature or change needs a hypothesis.
* If your app needs user registration to use, it's not helpful to hypothesis that account creation is needed.
* You could, however, hypothesis one form of registration may outperform another.
